        <h2 class="subtitle">High Risk Category</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Risk of a detached retina increases if one:
            <ul>
              <li>is having posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), where the vitreous separates from the retina due to it thinning with age. This happens to most people by age 70. It can cause floaters, but generally resolves on its own over time.</li>
              <li>is nearsighted, especially >5 diopters, where the retina is more thinly stretched, raising their risk to 1:20 per lifetime</li>
              <li>had cataract surgery</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>0.5 to 1.6%</li>
                  <li>highly myopic increases to 7%</li>
                  <li>and detachment in other eye increases risk to 25-30%</li>
              </ul>
              <li>have glaucoma (disease affecting pressure inside eye)</li>
              <li>had a serious eye injury</li>
              <li>had a retinal tear or detachment in other eye increases risk to 15% in other eye</li>
              <li>has family member who had retinal detachment</li>
              <li>has weak areas in retina</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If one is in a higher risk category, then wise to avoid activities which jostle or put pressure on the eye in any way:
            <ul>
                <li>high-impact or high speed sports, such as football, bungee jumping, roller coaster, and other amusement rides</li>
                <li>activities that increase pressure in eye, like diving and skydiving</li>
                <li>using equipment like jack hammers</li>
                <li>heavy lifting, especially bending over and lifting</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Warning Signs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Signs of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or a retinal tear:
            <ul>
                <li>see very brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision</li>
                <li>seeing many new floaters at once</li>
                <li>shadow appearing in peripheral (side) vision</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If a retinal tear is treated with laser or cryotherapy, the risk of retinal detachment reduces from 1:3 to 1:20.</li>
          <li>
             Signs of a detached retina:
            <ul>
              <li>PVD symptoms</li>
              <li>gray curtain covering part of field of vision</li>
              <li>a dense shadow that starts in the peripheral vision and slowly progresses towards the central vision</li>
              <li>straight lines (scale, edge of the wall, road, etc.) that suddenly appear curved</li>
              <li>central vision loss</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If one experiences any of the symptoms of PVD or detached retina, see an eye doctor IMMEDIATELY.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a retinal tear occurs but the retina does not detach, cryotherapy using a cold probe or photocoagulation using a laser can be used to secure the tear back to the retina.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Surgery</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the retina detaches, surgery is required as soon as possible, typically within 24 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            The surgery lasts takes about 75 to 90 minutes with the patient under anesethia.
          </li>
          <li>
            85% of cases will be successfully treated with just 1 operation. 95% of cases of retinal detachment can be repaired successfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            In cases where the macula is not involved, 90% have 20/40 vision or better after reattachment surgery.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The surgeon performs a vitrectomyto remove all of the vitreous, which is pulling on the retina.</li>
          <li>The vitreous is replaced with a gas (typically), air, or oil bubble inserted into the center of the eye. The bubble pushes the retina back into place using surface tension, so it can heal properly.</li>
          <li>After the gas is injected into the eye, laser or freezing treatment is applied to the retinal hole. </li>
          <li>If an oil bubble was used, the surgeon must remove it a few months later. If a gas or air bubble was used, the bubble will slowly shrink over about an 8 week period as the body naturally makes fluid to fill the cavity the vitreous used to fill. With an air or gas bubble, one cannot fly in an airplane or travel to high altitudes which causes the gas to expand increasing eye pressure with possibility of the eye exploding.</li>
          <li>A scleral buckle (a band of rubber, soft plastic, or silicone) is sewn to the outside of the eyeball. It gently presses the eye inward to help the detached retina heal against the eye wall. The location of the buckle is not visible from outside nor is it in the line of sight. However, the buckle changes the shape of the eyeball making the vision nearsighted and diminishing the peripheral vision somewhat. The buckle is usually left on the eye permanently.</li>
          <li>If a gas bubble was inserted, one needs to remain in a certain position to allow the bubble to rise to the location of the detachment. Typically, one has to lay face down 24 hours a day for 1 to 2 weeks with only 10 minute breaks every hour. Usually a massage chair and accessories are rented to enable this position more comfortably while awake and sleeping.</li>
          <li>Will have to wear an eye patch constantly for 1 week, and at night for 2 weeks.</li>
          <li>One needs to avoid jarring motions, such as jogging, tennis, etc. for several weeks to avoid putting strain on the retina. Balance will be affected, since the bubble bounces around inside the eye with even the slightest movement.</li>
          <li>Sight should begin to improve about 4 weeks after surgery.</li>
          <li>By the 8th week, the bubble should have dissipated, and one can then fly and travel to altitudes.</li>
          <li>It could take months after surgery for vision to stop changing, and the retina could take as much as a year or more to heal.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately, the gas bubble used to secure the retina typically ends up causing a cataract (clouding of the eye's lens, which can block light from entering the eye and focusing clearly). After about 3 months, one can consider lens replacement surgery, which is in a different part of the eye.
